Recommendations to Reduce Attrition:
For BusinessTravel, prioritize support for 'Travel_Frequently' employees (attrition rate: 24.91%) over 'Non-Travel' (attrition rate: 8.00%). Reduce travel or provide travel benefits for frequent travelers.

Younger employees (Attrition=Yes median: 32.00, Attrition=No median: 36.00) are more likely to leave. 
No clear action needed for PercentSalaryHike (Attrition=Yes median: 14.00, Attrition=No median: 14.00), as higher values are associated with attrition.
Retain employees with lower TotalWorkingYears (Attrition=Yes median: 7.00, Attrition=No median: 10.00) through onboarding, loyalty bonuses, or stronger manager relationships.
No clear action needed for TrainingTimesLastYear (Attrition=Yes median: 3.00, Attrition=No median: 3.00), as more training is associated with attrition.
Retain employees with lower YearsAtCompany (Attrition=Yes median: 3.00, Attrition=No median: 6.00) through onboarding, loyalty bonuses, or stronger manager relationships.
No clear action needed for YearsSinceLastPromotion (Attrition=Yes median: 1.00, Attrition=No median: 1.00), as recent promotions are associated with attrition.
Retain employees with lower YearsWithCurrManager (Attrition=Yes median: 2.00, Attrition=No median: 3.00) through onboarding, loyalty bonuses, or stronger manager relationships.
